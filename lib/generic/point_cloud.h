    /// Why is it hacky?

    /// Let's return to the conceptual level and forget the inheritance for a
    /// moment:
    ///
    /// Both classes need a reference to the underlying `PointCloud`.
    ///
    /// If point cloud wants to return a `ConstantPoint` to a client,
    /// `ConstantPoint` needs to promise, not to change point cloud.
    ///
    /// But `Point` should be allowed to modify the underlying cloud.
    ///
    /// There are ways, to make the type system happy:
    ///
    /// - Create two abstract Read/Write classes with protected
    /// cloud()=0/constCloud()=0 methods and let the point classes inherit from
    /// them. Then Point no longer needs to inherit from ConstantPoint, can
    /// store its own reference and everything is fine. The problem: I try to
    /// make this class as efficient as possible, but having virtual methods
    /// doesn't seem as slim as possible.
    ///
    /// - Introduce duplicated code for read-operations: Both classes are
    /// completely independent but we get penalized by having a larger code
    /// size and a higher chance of bugs since we need to maintain redundant
    /// code.
    ///
    /// - Probably better/cleaner solutions then the one implemented, please
    /// tell me in that case.
    ///
    /// The most efficient way seems to let `Point` inherit from
    /// `ConstantPoint` and make sure that `ConstantPoint` never breaks its
    /// promise on its own.
    ///
    /// Single exception: It is allowed to do one thing:
    /// hand on a modifyable reference to its child as it is the
    /// only purpose of `Point` to actually modify things.
    ///
    /// This definitely breaks the one or other OO-principle, but I haven't
    /// found a cleaner way to get rid of all unnecessary overhead.
