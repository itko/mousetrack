/// ***The Mean Shift Algorithm***
/// Goal: assign each given point to a cluster based on the nearest local
/// maximum of the point density.
///
/// Algorithm:
/// 1. At each point location, a cluster is initialized.
/// 2. For each cluster i:
///    i) Apply a gaussian kernel centered at the location of i to all points.
///    ii) The new location of i is the weighted center of gravity of the
///    points. Weights are given by the gaussian kernel. iii) Repeat i and ii
///    until the location of i converges.
/// 3. All clusters that are sufficiently close to each other are merged into
/// one cluster.
