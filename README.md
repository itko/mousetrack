# Mousetrack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Fluci/mousetrack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Fluci/mousetrack)

Using computer vision to track a mouse in a cage.

## Dependencies

TL;DR: Convenient one-liner for Ubuntu:
``` bash
$ sudo apt install -y cmake libboost-all-dev libopencv-dev libeigen3-dev libflann-dev librosbag-dev libsensor-msgs-dev libimage-transport-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libbz2-dev qt5-default
```

There are some issues with libpng, depending on your machine configuration you might need to run ```$sudo apt install -y libpng16-dev``` or ```$ sudo apt install -y libpng-dev``` in addition.


- CMake: `$ sudo apt install cmake`
- Boost.Test: `$ sudo apt install libboost-all-dev`
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html): `$ sudo apt install libopencv-dev`
- Eigen: `$ sudo apt install libeigen3-dev`
- We need to read PNG files: `$ sudo apt install libpng16-dev`
- We need to read PNG files: `$ sudo apt install libpng16-dev` (comes with OpenCV)
- QT: `$ sudo apt install qt5-default`
- ROS bag support: `$ sudo apt install librosbag-dev libsensor-msgs-dev libimage-transport-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libbz2-dev`
- We use FLANN for spatial queries: `$ sudo apt install libflann-dev` (comes with OpenCV)


If operations run slow, you can try reinstalling OpenCV with these additional dependencies:
- Atlas: `$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran`

If you have trouble meeting some dependencies, there's always the option to turn off unused modules.
Please see the root `CMakeLists.txt` for the corresponding flags (`ENABLE_GUI`, `ENABLE_ROSBAG`, etc.).

#### Python dependencies

You don't need these for the main application, but there is a folder with useful helper scripts (`scripts`) for post processing.

Those need following dependencies:

```bash
$ pip3 install opencv-python plyfile matplotlib
$ sudo apt install python3-tk

```

### Version requirements

This list is not complete, but might help you to finding possible problems when compiling for the first time.
Feel free to add or adjust entries on your own experience.

- g++ 4.9 or larger: we need C++11 with regex fully implemented, g++ 4.8 or below won't work
- gcc 5.4 is known to work
- clang 3.8 is known to work
- libpng 1.2 and 1.6 are known to work
- boost 1.56 and 1.58 are known to work
- OpenCV 3.3 is known to work
- Eigen 2.91 is known to work

## Build project

TL;DR:
``` bash
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. & make -j7
```

We use CMake as main building tool. CMake uses one or more input files (called `CMakeLists.txt`), to understand how to compile the project.
You can find those files in the root of the project and in the `lib/` and `app/` folders.

With CMake, you usually create an empty build folder.
From that folder you can run `$ cmake ..` to run the configuration which creates, for example, Makefiles.
Those Makefiles can be executed with `$ make` which compiles the code, and creates executables/libraries/etc.

CMake supports to build release and debug versions.

This project uses `build/` as a release folder and `build-debug` for a debuggable build.

Run `$ ./create_cmake.sh` to set up both folders automatically.

Note: you still need to run `make` in each folder separately to generate the binaries.


### Build Options

Certain modules can be turned off via cmake.

Example: Assume you only need to run the application in headless mode, so there's no point in compiling it with the GUI.
So, if you want to remove the GUI entirely for your build, you can run `cmake -DENABLE_GUI=OFF ..`.

For a complete list of options, please see the root CMakeLists.txt.


## Running the Application

TL;DR, run in `build`:

``` bash
./app/mousetrack -c -s </path/to/extracted/bag/data/0123-45-67> --log trace --pipeline-timer --out-dir ./output-directory
```

Once you configured your build directory with `cmake ..` and created all targets with `make`, you should find an executable in the `app` subdirectory called `mousetrack`. You have two basic modes at your disposal:

- The Graphical User Interface: By default, if you just run `./app/mousetrack`, the GUI will be started.
- Headless mode:
No GUI will be set up and all options need to be provided at the start of the application via the command line arguments.
See `./mousetrack --help` for a list of available options.


### Issues

#### Application is slow

Make sure to create a release version of the application, you enforce this by running `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..`. The debug version is not optimized and contains additional code for debugging.

Certain modules are parallelized via OpenMP, make sure you have OpenMP available and configured correctly on your system.


## Code Documentation

You can generate HTML/LaTex/... documentation automatically from source code.
For this you need to install [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
Doxygen can also create nice class hierarchy diagrams and similar things, for this [Dot](http://www.graphviz.org/download/) from graphviz is needed.

If you've installed Doxygen successfully, you can run `$ doxygen` in the root of the project.

All generated documentation files will be placed in the folder `docs/`.

## Logging

We use Boost.Test as logging framework.

For the moment, I recommend using `BOOST_LOG_TRIVIAL` ([official docs](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/log/doc/html/log/tutorial.html)). This should give us enough control while being easy to use.

To add logging to your source file, add this to your header:

``` C++
#include <boost/log/trivial.hpp>
```

Usage example directly taken from the docs:

``` C++
BOOST_LOG_TRIVIAL(trace) << "A trace severity message";
```

`trace` is the severity level. There are six severity levels. While the "importance" increases going down the list, I'm not aware of exact definitions for the levels. I've hence added some rough thoughts as a starting point. In the end it probably won't matter to much which exact level is used.

- `trace`

    The finest level, it is allowed to print the input and output of each "step" of an algorithm.
    This means it is allowed to produce tons of output which could flood the logging system if turned on for a longer period of time.

    Example: We print the function state after each line of an algorithm.

- `debug`

    Information events needed to find bugs in a software.
    Think of it as checkpoints, one should be able to decide, if a certain part of the application state is still valid at this point. It should help to reduce the amount of code a bug could be hidden in.

    Example: Print the absolute paths of files to make sure they are correct.

- `info`

    The application behaves according to specifications but might surprise a user, since an edge case was encountered.

    Example: We scan a directory and the specification defines to ignore files we don't expect.
    A user might want to know if a file was ignored, and maybe why it was ignored.

- `warning`

    There might be a bug somewhere (for example a forgotten switch statement entry) or a base assumption was violated.

    Example: We performed a scan of a directory and stored some file paths in memory.
    When we come back at a later point, some files were removed by the user.

- `error`

    This obviously is a bug, but isn't urgent. For the moment we can recover from this event.

    Example: The contract of a function was violated.
    As a result, a transaction couldn't be performed.
    The violation of the contract clearly is a bug that needs to be fixed, but a transaction is allowed to fail, which gives the application the chance to recover.

- `fatal`

    Wake me (the developer) up in the middle of the night, this should never ever happen.
    This is an error with fatal consequences, it might cost a lot of money/lives/cute kittens if ignored.

    Example: A safety check in a financial application trading stocks failed, million of dollars could be lost.

## Testing

To run tests, call `./run_tests.sh` from within the build directory (your build directory should be located at the project root).
This will set up the necessary environment (creating a mock file system, etc.) and run all test binaries.
If everything succeeds, it will return an error code of 0.

To add new tests, create a new file with the suffix `.test.cc` and add it to its corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` (either in `app/` or `lib/`).
For the exact skeleton and available Macros, see an existing unit test or the [Boost.Test](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools.html) documentation.


## Examples

In the folder `examples` you can find a bunch of bash scripts, demonstrating different pipeline configurations. Assuming you have a compiled executable of `mousetrack`, run the scripts in the same directory, for example in `build/app`, if you run CMake in `./build`.

Each script takes a "minimum" of parameters, this means in the best case you only need to provide the input and output paths, while parameters are "hard-coded" in the bash script.

Output is all written to the output directory. Note that a lot of data is written by default, this gives you the chance to inspect the in-between steps and get a feeling for what is happening.

The scripts try to provide a starting point for further parameter tweaking as they already hold "reasonable" configurations.

For further information, please see the comments inside each bash script.

Here some scripts you might want to try to get started:

- `raw_reconstruction.sh`: This script only takes an input and an output path. All it does is to reconstruct the entire 3D data. Use this to get an idea of your dataset in 3D.

- `baseline.sh`:
 This scripts assumes the first frame window of your data to be "empty", hence the object you want to observe is not visible in any camera view.
 The baseline subtracts the background from each frame, hence you only find changes in the observed are.
 Use this script, to get an idea of how something moves in a scene.

- `hog_baseline.sh`:
 One important feature is hog labeling, it allows you to perform some rudimentary pixel-wise labeling on the reference image. In addition to the input and output paths, you will also need a csv file holding HOG feature vectors for your subject. This script is useful if you intend to find, for example, body parts of an animal.
